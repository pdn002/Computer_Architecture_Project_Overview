# Computer Architecture Project Overview
<br/>

## Broad Design Ideas
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our architecture will be a single cycle implementation. This means that every instruction will only take up one clock cycle. The ISA will also follow the data memory load/store principle which means that there are only two instructions that can access data memory. No other instruction can access data memory so an ADD instruction can not add two numbers then immediately store the result into data memory. The goal of this ISA is to minimize the number of different instructions so that machine code instructions will use less bits to specify what operations will be performed. This will allow instructions to have more bits reserved for specifying the operation registers and values. Making the ISA single cycle should also simplify the hardware design making it more intuitive.

## Instruction List
| NAME | BIT BREAKDOWN | EXAMPLE | NOTES |

| MR1 | 4 bit opcode 0000, <br/> 1 bit \=  0 is register and 1 is immediate <br/> 4 bit \= what we want to store into R1 (whether it represent register or immediate depends on the 1 bit mentioned above) | MR1 \#3 <br/> // after MR1 instruction, R1 now holds 0b’0000\_0011 | This operation is moving immediate or register address into R1 |
| MR2 | 4 bit opcode 0001, <br/> 1 bit \=  0 is register and 1 is immediate <br/> 4 bit \= what we want to store into R2 (whether it represent register or immediate depends on the 1 bit mentioned above) | MR2 \#32 <br/> // after MR1 instruction, R2 now holds 0b’0010\_0000 | This operation is moving immediate or register address into R2 |
